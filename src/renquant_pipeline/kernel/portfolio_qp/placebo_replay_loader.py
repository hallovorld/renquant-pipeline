"""§7.2 placebo loaders for the QP Step-4 A/B replay (#212 / Step-4h
follow-up). Per §7.2.1 R2, any Sharpe/return quoted from the replay needs
a companion placebo verdict; these loaders provide it via the
`--loader-module` injection hook on `run_ab_replay`.

Mechanism: load the real bars, then break the decision<->outcome
alignment. If an allocator's measured edge is REAL (depends on the
mu/sigma signal predicting fwd_return), the paired ΔSharpe collapses
toward 0 under the placebo. If the edge SURVIVES the placebo, it is a
structural artifact of the allocator, not signal — and must not be
promoted.
