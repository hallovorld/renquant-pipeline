"""Alert escalation lifecycle — detection without lifecycle = noise (L6).

Design: renquant-orchestrator
doc/research/2026-06-12-engineering-architecture-deep-plan.md §12.3 / L6
audit sidecar. Graduates scripts/engineering/alert_lifecycle_prototype.py.

Motivating incident: the fundamentals-stale warning fired DAILY for ~4
months and was ignored — 121 identical ntfys train the operator to mute
the channel. The fix is a lifecycle, not louder alerts:

  NEW ──(first ntfy)──> WARN ──(unacked ≥ escalate_after_days)──> CRITICAL
                          │                                          │
                          └──────────(acked: never escalates)        │
  any state ──(condition absent on a later day)──> RESOLVED          │
  CRITICAL scopes are returned by blocking_scopes() for the L6 barrier.

Dedup key = (audit, scope, cause_hash): a 121-day-old condition is ONE
escalating incident with exactly TWO notifications (NEW + escalation),
not 121 identical warnings. Pure: no DB, no ntfy — the caller persists
the book and fires notifications off the returned deltas.
