"""ArtifactResolver — the ONE artifact path-resolution authority.

Design: renquant-orchestrator doc/research/2026-06-12-engineering-architecture-deep-plan.md
§III.5 "Artifact plane" (S1-PR5); prototype with proof obligations against
the production layout: scripts/engineering/artifact_resolver_prototype.py
(orchestrator PR #112 batch).

Why one authority (incident #2, renquant-pipeline PR #114): the primary
scorer resolved config refs strategy_dir-first while the shadow scorer
resolved repo-root-first. The same ref string pointed at two different
files, and the shadow artifact was silently dead for a week. Any code
that turns a config ref into a filesystem path must call this module and
nothing else, so a ref means exactly one thing everywhere.

Resolution order (fixed, never per-caller):
  1. absolute ref           → itself
  2. strategy_dir / ref     → the strategy bundle owns its artifacts
  3. repo_root / ref        → umbrella-level fallback (legacy layouts)

Two entry points for the two legitimate consumer shapes:
  * ``resolve_artifact``  — fail-closed loader path: raises
    FileNotFoundError listing every candidate tried, and returns a sha256
    prefix that feeds the run fingerprint (DRPH, eng plan §IV.2).
  * ``locate_artifact``   — preflight/check path: never raises; returns
    the first existing candidate, or the strategy_dir candidate when
    nothing exists so the caller can report a precise missing path.
