"""Post-scoring drift audit — the L6 sidecar integration point.

Design: renquant-orchestrator
doc/research/2026-06-12-engineering-architecture-deep-plan.md §L6 audit
sidecar. Ties together the three primitives shipped separately:

  * kernel.score_drift.load_score_drift_from_db   — MEASURE
  * persistence.record_score_drift_audit          — PERSIST (queryable history)
  * kernel.alert_lifecycle.AlertBook              — ESCALATE (no daily noise)

One call, ``run_score_drift_audit``, does all three: compute the latest
full-run PSI vs the trailing baseline, append it to score_drift_audits,
and (when an AlertBook is supplied) fold the verdict into the escalation
lifecycle so a CRITICAL that fires every run until retrain is ONE
escalating incident, not N daily alarms. Pure orchestration — no ntfy,
no broker; the caller fires notifications off the returned alert's rising
notification count and persists the book.

Designed to run concurrently with / just after scoring, per the operator
mandate "pipeline 中应该有自行审计 task … early detect data abnormal".
Read-mostly: it reads candidate_scores and appends only to the audit
log; it never touches a decision.
