"""Decision-tree kernel primitives lifted from the umbrella.

Per RFC §"Backfill Plan" functional-lift (copy-not-move), these modules are
copied verbatim from `backtesting/renquant_104/kernel/` into the pipeline
package and verified import-clean here. The umbrella keeps its working copy
until cutover.

Current slice — pure decision leaves (stdlib + numpy/pandas only, no
internal kernel imports):

* ``kelly``        — fractional-Kelly position sizing
* ``exit_types``   — exit signal value types
* ``market_gates`` — buy-side market gates
* ``vol_target``   — volatility targeting
* ``sizing``       — position sizing helpers
