"""Panel-LTR inference kernel package — parallel to kernel/pipeline/.

Swaps the per-ticker `ScoreBuyTask` + `RankingJob` pair for a single
cross-sectional `ComputePanelScoresTask` + `PanelRankGateTask` pair
driven by a trained `PanelLTRModel` artifact.

This package is `common/`-free so it can run under LEAN and the live
runner. The training side lives in `training_panel/` (notebook / cron).

Entry points::

    from renquant_pipeline.kernel.panel_pipeline import (
        PanelScorer,               # thin loader around the saved artifact
        compute_panel_scores,      # pure function: (artifact, feature_matrix) → scores
        top_n_by_score,            # rank gate: keep top-N
        probability_gate,          # rank gate: keep score ≥ threshold
