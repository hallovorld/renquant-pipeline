"""TopUpHeldTask — Kelly-driven add-to-existing-position.

Plan C + AB (2026-04-23 evening):

The selection loop + rotation only handle NEW buys and 1:1 swaps.
Neither can *add* to an already-held position whose Kelly target
exceeds its current weight. Without this Task, a held ticker whose
calibrated score spikes (stronger edge) stays stuck at the weight we
entered at.

This Task runs after SelectionJob. For each held ticker not already
in the current bar's orders or exits:

  current_pct  = shares * price / portfolio_value
  kelly_target = HoldingState.kelly_target_pct       (set by
                  PanelScoringJob::ApplyScoresTask)
  delta        = kelly_target - current_pct

If delta > `ranking.kelly_sizing.top_up_threshold` (default 0.05), emit
an extra BUY order of floor(delta * portfolio / price) shares into
`ctx.orders` so adapter.commit ships it to the broker.

This is additive and non-destructive: never sells, only tops up. Trim
(reduce over-weight positions) is a separate Task (TrimHeldTask)
which requires the partial-sell path and is scoped for the next
session.
