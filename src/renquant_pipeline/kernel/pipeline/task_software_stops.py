"""SoftwareStopExitTask — the sell-only loop's software-stop pass.

S-FRAC stage 3 core (sprint D2). Design: renquant-orchestrator
doc/design/2026-07-02-s-frac-fractional-v2.md §3.2.3 — "the sell-only
loop evaluates registry entries each pass exactly like its existing
stop-loss rule and emits a fractional market SELL on breach".

The registry (adapters/software_stops.SoftwareStopRegistry) is attached
to ctx by RunnerAdapter.make_context as ``ctx.software_stops``; it is
None unless ``execution.software_stops.enabled`` — in which case this
task is a no-op (flag-off byte-inert).

Placement in SellOnlyPipeline: AFTER MetaLabelVetoTask and
LimitSellsPerBarTask, by design not by accident. The software stop is
the loop-resident mirror of a broker-resident Z9 GTC stop, and a broker
stop can neither be vetoed by the meta-label model nor capped by the
per-bar sell limit — so its mirror is not either. Defense in depth: the
``software_stop`` exit type is also in the exit-type taxonomy's
PANEL_VETO_BYPASS / PER_BAR_CAP_EXEMPT sets (kernel/exit_types.py), so
even a re-ordering could not silently subject it to those gates.
