"""PanelRankVetoTask — block per-ticker `model_sell` exits when the held
position still ranks strong in the cross-sectional panel.

**Theoretical motivation** (per user audit 2026-04-26):

Per-ticker XGBoost / Classification / QLearning / Manual models are
trained in isolation — they only see the ticker's own indicators
(RSI, MACD, momentum…). They have no awareness of:
  * the ticker's panel rank vs other watchlist tickers
  * the current regime (BULL_CALM / CHOPPY / BEAR)
  * relative strength vs sector ETF or SPY

Consequence: a ticker that ranks #1 in the panel (rank_score ~ 0.85)
can still trigger a per-ticker `model_sell` because its OWN MACD
crossed down, even though it's the strongest holding in the universe.
Round-3 e2e showed exactly this — GOOG and AMZN both sold despite
panel-LTR not flagging them as weak (joint_sell menu was empty).

Fix: when a per-ticker model_sell would fire, check the panel-LTR's
calibrated rank_score for the held. If it's above `min_rank_score`
(default 0.5 = >50% probability of forward outperformance), VETO
the sell and let the position stay another bar.

**What we DON'T veto** (these are risk-driven, must fire regardless
of panel rank):
  * stop_loss     - drawdown breach
  * trailing_stop - HWM-based protection
  * single_day_loss / gap_down - intraday catastrophe
  * max_hold      - tax / holding-period gate
  * rotation      - already a panel-aware swap
  * joint_sell    - panel-driven exit (already conscious of panel)
  * kelly_trim    - panel-aware rebalance (μ/σ² target)

**Streak cap** (audit fix PV-NEW-7): when the per-ticker model has been
signalling SELL for ``max_streak_to_veto`` consecutive **trading days**
(default 5 — about 1 week of trading), the veto STOPS firing for that
held — persistent weakness override. Prevents "stuck" scenarios where
panel ranks the held strong forever but the per-ticker model keeps
insisting on exit. Note: each bar = one trading day; weekends excluded.

**Dependency** (audit fix PV-NEW-9): this task assumes
``ranking.panel_scoring.global_calibration.enabled = true`` so that
`held.rank_score` is the calibrated panel-LTR probability. Without
calibration, `held.rank_score` would be the per-ticker model score
(which is what we're trying to veto on) — using it as the veto signal
would be self-contradictory. Run-time check below logs a warning.

**Telemetry**: every veto logged with ticker / score / threshold +
streak. ctx.counters["model_sell_vetoed"] tracks count. ctx.exits_vetoed
list lets ntfy surface "would have sold X but panel says strong".

Pipeline ordering: this Task runs at the START of Phase 3 (after
PanelScoringJob populates rank_score on holdings, but BEFORE
RankingJob / JointActionJob / SelectionJob act on the exits).
