"""LimitSellsPerBarTask — portfolio-level cap on model_sell exits per bar.

User spec 2026-04-26 round-7: "把我有的股票全卖了？这他妈的合理吗？"
Pre-fix, a single bar could exit 3-of-6 holdings simultaneously when
multiple per-ticker models all spiked sell signals on the same day.
Per-ticker rules can't see the portfolio-level effect — this task is
the portfolio manager's safety brake.

    Transactions", J. Risk 3(2): 5-39. — temporary market impact grows
    with execution rate; concentrated same-bar liquidations incur
    super-linear cost penalty (motivates spreading sells across bars).

    — diversification rationale; mass-exit destroys variance benefit
    accumulated through prior position-building.

Behavior:
  * Counts `model_sell`, `panel_conviction`, and `model_protection` exits in
    ctx.exits — all are "soft" signal-driven exits (audit fix 2026-04-29:
    panel_conviction is a MODEL signal, not a price-action stop, so it shares
    the cap).
  * If combined count exceeds `risk.max_sells_per_bar`, sort by NGBoost
    μ ascending (most-bearish first), keep the top N, drop the rest.
  * Hard risk exits (stop_loss / trailing_stop / single_day_loss /
    max_hold / rotation / kelly_trim / gap_down / joint_sell) are EXEMPT
    — they always fire because their triggers are deterministic price
    events, not signal.
  * Default OFF (max_sells_per_bar=0 means uncapped).

Wired into both InferencePipeline and SellOnlyPipeline AFTER the
parallel sell-aggregation step, BEFORE PanelRankVetoJob.

# Canonical exit-type taxonomy (CLAUDE.md §5.13.5 — one source).
# Refactored 2026-05-11 from inline frozenset to module import.
#
# Audit history (2026-04-29): `panel_conviction` was moved OUT of the
# exempt set and INTO the soft set — conviction loss is a MODEL signal
# not a hard price stop, so it's subject to the per-bar cap. Hard
# risk-class exits (stop_loss, trailing, gap, max_hold) stay exempt
# because their triggers are deterministic price events.
