        balances asymmetric pain of forced exit vs. holding cost.


    Blocks `model_sell` exit signals when the latest NGBoost edge-Sharpe
    (μ/σ) is NOT sufficiently negative. Path-dependent rules
    (stop_loss, trailing_stop, single_day_loss, max_hold) are EXEMPT —
    they always fire. Only the streak-based model exit goes through
    Gate B, mirroring the asymmetric rule on the buy side where path
    rules don't see Gate B either.

    User spec 2026-04-26 round-7: "你的 portfolio manager不管卖吗？"
    Pre-fix the sell path had only per-ticker model + path rules. Buy
    path has Gate A/B/C as a quality floor; sell side had no analog —
    so a single-day model spike could exit a holding the panel/μ still
    likes. This task adds the symmetric guard.

    Semantics:
      * Reads `hs.mu`, `hs.sigma` (set by PanelScoringJob in the previous
        bar; persists on HoldingState).
      * If `μ/σ > -threshold`, blocks model_sell. (Buy gate uses
        `μ/σ ≥ +threshold`; sell mirror requires `μ/σ ≤ -threshold` to
        proceed.)
      * Doesn't touch the streak — model can keep accumulating sell
        signals; once edge-Sharpe drops below the floor, the existing
        streak fires immediately.
      * On block, clears tc.exit_signal so PanelConvictionExitTask gets
        a chance to run (panel_conviction has its own μ check inside).

    Pre-conditions:
      * `ranking.panel_scoring.sell_gate_b.enabled = true`
      * NGBoost μ/σ available on the holding (from prior PanelScoringJob)
      * exit_signal is `model_sell` (NOT a path rule)

    Falls through gracefully (no block) when:
      * Flag off (default)
      * No exit_signal, or signal is not should_exit
      * exit_type is not "model_sell"
      * μ or σ unavailable (panel disabled / first bar after entry / warmup)
      * σ <= 0 or NaN (defensive — same as buy-side)

    User spec 2026-04-24: "买卖换加减仓都要是 model+policy" — sell was
    the only surface using only per-ticker tournament model + price rules.
    This task adds a panel-based exit that consults the calibrated
    panel score + NGBoost μ/σ (persisted on HoldingState from the
    previous bar's PanelScoringJob).

    Fires only when the current priority chain did NOT already fire
    (checked via tc.exit_signal). That way stop-loss / trailing / max-hold
    always win first, and this is the tiebreaker for "nothing else said
    exit but the model has turned bearish".

    Trigger conditions (when `risk.panel_exit.enabled=true`):
      * hs.rank_score < panel_sell_floor (default 0.20 — below tier 1
        A-gate threshold, so the calibrated probability now disagrees
        with the original entry conviction)
      * hs.mu <= mu_sell_ceiling (default 0.0 — NGBoost says no edge)

    Audit (2026-04-24): the comparison is against `rank_score`, NOT
    `panel_score`. After PanelScoringJob, `rank_score` is the calibrated
    probability (0..1 range, matching the tier-gate scale that the
    `panel_sell_floor=0.20` default targets). `panel_score` is the raw
    LTR output (~N(0,1)) or μ−λσ (~±0.05 in NGBoost mode); comparing
    those to a probability-scale floor would fire on ~58% of holdings
    (raw mode) or ALL holdings (μ−λσ mode). Requires
    `ranking.panel_scoring.global_calibration.enabled=true` for the
    rank_score field to carry probability-scale values from the panel
    pipeline; tournament-only (panel disabled) holdings already get
    probability-scale rank_score from ScoreModelTask.

    Legacy task default remains ON for backward compatibility when
    `risk.panel_exit.enabled=true`. Production configs that use
    CrossSectionalPanelExitTask should set `risk.panel_exit.legacy_enabled`
    to false so one panel-exit policy owns the decision.

    """Veto model-driven exits inside the earnings event-blackout window.

    Invariant
    ---------
    Model-driven exits (`model_sell`, `panel_conviction`) are SUPPRESSED when
    the holding sits inside its earnings event-blackout window. Path-action
    exits (`stop_loss`, `trailing_stop`, `single_day_loss`, `max_hold`,
    `kelly_trim`, `rotation`) ALWAYS fire — they are price-action signals not
    affected by event-driven information asymmetries.

    Window is asymmetric:
      * pre_days  (default 2): tighter window before a known print — operator
        is expected to size down voluntarily, not panic-exit on a model spike
        in the run-up.
      * post_days (default 5): wider window after the print to respect
        Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (Bernard & Thomas 1989; Sadka 2006;
        Hirshleifer-Lim-Teoh 2009). Pure-momentum signals systematically
        whipsaw against the drift — give it room to play out.

    Motivating incident
    -------------------
    2026-05-01 trade audit: CAT printed Q1 EPS $5.54 vs $4.62 est (+19.9%
    beat) on 2026-04-30, single-day +9.88%. The per-ticker tournament model
    accumulated `streak=3` model_sell signals through the print, and on
    2026-05-01 the system sold CAT into the post-beat strength — a textbook
    momentum-vs-PEAD whipsaw. This Task is the structural fix.

    Pre-conditions
    --------------
    * `regime.earnings_sell_buffer_pre_days  >= 0` (default 2)
    * `regime.earnings_sell_buffer_post_days >= 0` (default 5)
    * `tc.earnings_calendar` is dict[ticker → list[ISO date strings]]
      (populated by `_make_sell_tctx` from `ctx.earnings_calendar`)

    Falls through gracefully (no veto) when:
      * No exit_signal, or signal is not should_exit
      * exit_type is a path rule (stop/trailing/SDL/max_hold/kelly_trim/rotation)
      * earnings_calendar missing or no dates for this ticker
      * No earnings date within the asymmetric window
      * Both pre and post buffer = 0 (operator-disabled)
