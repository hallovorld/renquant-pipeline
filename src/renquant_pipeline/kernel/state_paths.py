"""Broker-isolated state file paths.

The 2026-04-27 incident: a ``--broker paper`` smoke run wrote synthetic
positions into ``live_state.json``; the next ``--broker alpaca`` invocation
read those fake positions instead of the real Alpaca account state. This
module centralises path construction so each broker (paper / alpaca-paper /
alpaca / ibkr) gets its own state file and runs.db.

Naming convention
-----------------
- ``live_state.alpaca.json``        — real Alpaca live account
- ``live_state.alpaca_paper.json``  — Alpaca paper account
- ``live_state.paper.json``         — in-process simulation
- ``live_state.ibkr.json``          — future
- ``data/runs.alpaca.db``           — analogous SQLite store

The single legacy ``live_state.json`` (pre-isolation) is treated as a
read-only fallback when a broker-specific file does not exist yet —
useful during the migration window. New writes always go to the
broker-specific path; legacy is never overwritten.
