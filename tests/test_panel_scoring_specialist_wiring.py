"""Integration test for Track C specialist ensemble wiring (subrepo mirror).

AUDIT REGRESSION GUARD for codex finding on PR #18:

    HIGH: specialist runtime is not wired. load_panel_scorer_with_ensemble
    is defined, the `specialists` config block is documented, but
    LoadScorerTask still loads through model_registry and ApplyScoresTask
    still calls scorer.score(X) without forwarding ctx. So a configured
    `ranking.panel_scoring.specialists` is dead code.

Mirrors umbrella ``tests/test_panel_scoring_specialist_wiring.py`` per
CLAUDE.md §3.5 paired-PR invariant. Proves:

  1. ``LoadScorerTask`` reads ``ranking.panel_scoring.specialists`` and
     routes through ``load_panel_scorer_with_ensemble`` — yielding a
     ``RegimeEnsemblePanelScorer`` on ``ctx._panel_scorer``.
  2. ``ApplyScoresTask`` forwards ``ctx`` to ``scorer.score(...)`` so the
     ensemble dispatches to the correct specialist based on
     ``ctx.final_regime`` / ``ctx.regime_confidence``.
  3. The specialist's score column distribution is observably DIFFERENT
     from the global scorer's — proving the specialist (not the global)
     is the one consumed at runtime.

Per CLAUDE.md §7.1 paired-test invariant; pins the wiring against
regression. Without this test the configured specialists path is a
runtime no-op and the bug recurs the moment someone refactors
LoadScorerTask.
